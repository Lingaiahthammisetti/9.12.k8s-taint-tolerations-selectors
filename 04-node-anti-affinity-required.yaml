# Important Point on Node Anti-Affinity:
# Kubernetes doesn't have a nodeAntiAffinity field because all node selection is handled through nodeAffinity. Anti-affinity behavior is expressed using negative operators like NotIn or DoesNotExist within nodeAffinity.

# Label the node:
# Quick checklist for this to work:
# Label your node:
# kubectl label node my-node project=expense

# Create the pod with your YAML file:
# kubectl apply -f your-pod.yaml

# Check pod placement and node labels:
# kubectl get pods -o wide
# kubectl get nodes --show-labels
